Python 3 readiness

Python 3 support graph for most popular Python libraries and packages http://py3readiness.org


## How do you identify Python 3 support?

This site utilizes little tool, [caniusepython3](https://github.com/brettcannon/caniusepython3) created by Brett Cannon. 

Throw your `requirements.txt` file at it and it will tell you which packages support Python 3, and list out which don't.
